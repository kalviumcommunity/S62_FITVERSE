# ASAP project 

Frontend Setup Tech Stack: React

Backend Setup Tech Stack: Express, Nodemon, CORS, Mongoose.

 I’ve built the frontend using React and added a backend powered by Express, Nodemon, CORS, and Mongoose for managing the server and database.


## Frontend Setup
- I’ve used cd frontend to navigate into the frontend directory.
- I’ve used npm install to install all the necessary dependencies for the frontend, like React.
- I’ve used npm start to launch the React development server and open the application in my browser.

## Backend Setup
- I’ve used cd backend to navigate into the backend directory.
- I’ve used npm install to install backend dependencies like    Express, Nodemon, CORS, and Mongoose.
- I’ve used npm run dev to start the backend server in development mode with automatic restarts using Nodemon.
